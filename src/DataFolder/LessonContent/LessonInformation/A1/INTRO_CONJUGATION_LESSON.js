      "Conjugating verbs in Italian is the process of changing the form of a verb to match the subject of a sentence and to indicate when the action is happening. It's similar to how we change verbs in English, but Italian verbs have more specific rules.",

    <h3>Examples of Conjugation </h3>
    <p> Lets see below in english how we do it with the verb  \"to speak\"</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I speak</li>
    <li>You speak</li>
    <li>He/She speaks</li>
    <li>We speak</li><li>You speak</li>
    <li>They speak</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p> Here we see how we adjust the verb to fit with <strong> who </strong> is doing the action and <strong>when</strong> they are doing it.</p>

    <h3>The Who?</h3>

    <p>In Italian, verb conjugation is closely tied to the grammatical persons, which indicate who is performing the action: <strong>the who</strong>. Italian verbs are conjugated differently for different persons, and there are seven persons in total. They are often expressed with the following pronouns:</p>
    <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Personal Pronouns</th>
        <th>Explanation</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Io</td>
        <td>This corresponds to the first person singular in English, meaning "I." For example, "Io parlo" means "I speak."</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Tu</td>
        <td>This is the informal second person singular, equivalent to "you" when speaking to one person casually. For example, "Tu parli" means "You speak."</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lui / Lei</td>
        <td>These correspond to the third person singular, equivalent to "he" and "she," respectively. For example, "Lui parla" means "He speaks," and "Lei parla" means "She speaks." "Lei" is also used in a formal context as a polite form of address, equivalent to "you" (singular, formal).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Noi</td>
        <td>This is the first person plural, equivalent to "we." For example, "Noi parliamo" means "We speak."</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Voi</td>
        <td>This is the second person plural and can be both formal and informal, equivalent to "you" when speaking to multiple people or in a formal context. For example, "Voi parlate" means "You all speak."</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Loro</td>
        <td>This corresponds to the third person plural, equivalent to "they." For example, "Loro parlano" means "They speak."</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h4>Side note</h4>
  <p> If english is your mother tongue, you may ask yourself where is "it"? However in italian "it" does not exist, everything has a gender. So for example in english you could say "Wheres the cockroach?!", "it's over there!". In italian you would say HE is over there because the cockroach is masculine </p>
  
  <h3>The When?</h3>
  <p> Before when we mentioned the <strong> when </strong>, we refer to the tenses which are essential to express when actions happen. In Italian, there are three primary tenses. </p>
  <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Present Tense</th>
    <td>This tense is used to talk about actions or events that have already happened in the past. For example, "I ate" becomes "Ho mangiato."</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Present Tense</th>
    <td>The present tense is for actions or events happening right now or things that are generally true. For example, "I eat" becomes "Io mangio."</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Future Tense</th>
    <td>The future tense is used to talk about actions or events that will happen in the future. For example, "I will eat" becomes "Io manger√≤."</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Additional Tenses</h3>
<p> In addition to these primary tenses, Italian, like many languages, has more tenses to convey specific details:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Imperfect Tense</th>
    <td>This tense describes ongoing or habitual actions in the past. For example, "I used to eat" becomes "Io mangiavo."</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Past Perfect Tense</th>
    <td>It's used for actions that happened before other actions in the past. For example, "I had eaten" becomes "Io avevo mangiato."</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Conditional Tense</th>
    <td>This tense is for actions that depend on a condition or a hypothetical situation. For example, "I would eat" becomes "Io mangerei."</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Subjunctive Tense</th>
    <td>This is used to express uncertainty, wishes, or unreal situations. For example, "I hope he eats" becomes "Spero che lui mangi."</td>
  </tr>
</table>
