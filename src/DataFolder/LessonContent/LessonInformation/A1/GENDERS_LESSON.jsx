      "In Italian, nouns have gender, which means they are classified as either masculine or feminine. This is important for learning definite articles(the) and for indefinite articles(a/an/some) which will be covered next lesson. Although some things may have 'masculine' or 'feminine' qualities or are used maybe more by a certain gender this does not change what gender the noun may have ",

           <h3>How to Determine Noun Gender</h3>
        <p>In Italian, the gender of a noun is not always immediately obvious from the word itself. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine the gender of Italian nouns:</p>
        </br>
        <ul>
          <li> Nouns ending in -o are typically masculine. For example, <em>libro</em> (book) is masculine. Other masculine nouns ending in -o include <em>ragazzo</em> (boy), <em>cane</em> (dog), <em>tavolo</em> (table), and <em>amico</em> (friend).</li>
  
          <li>Nouns ending in -a are generally feminine. For example, <em>casa</em> (house) is feminine. Additional feminine nouns ending in -a include <em>ragazza</em> (girl), <em>macchina</em> (car), <em>pizza</em> (pizza), and <em>lingua</em> (language).</li>
          
          <li>Keep in mind that there are exceptions to these patterns, so it's a good idea to memorize the gender of each noun as you learn them.</li>
        </ul>
    
    
        <h3>Examples</h3>

    <h3>Change of Spelling</h3>
    <p>In Italian, some nouns change when they become plural to keep their pronunciation similar to the singular form. This happens with words that end in -ca and -ga, where an -h is added in the plural. The same change also occurs in most nouns ending in -co with stress on the second-to-last syllable and nouns that finish in -go. This is done to make sure the plural sounds similar to the singular.</p>
