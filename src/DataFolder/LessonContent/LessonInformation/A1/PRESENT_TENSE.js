      "As we saw in the previous lesson, verbs need to conjugated. In Italian, regular verbs are categorized into three different conjugation patterns based on their infinitive endings: -are, -ere, and -ire. ",
    description: "[]",

    content: `
    <p> Every verb ends in one of these patterns, for example: with Mangiare, we see the pattern ending "ARE", for Mettere "ERE" and for Vivire "IRE".  Each of these patterns follows a consistent set of rules for conjugating verbs in the present tense.</p>

    <h3>Exceptions</h3>
    <p> These are the basic rules for conjugating regular verbs in the present tense in Italian. It's important to note that irregular verbs may not follow these patterns, and some verbs may undergo orthographic changes in their stems when conjugated in the present tense. However, these are the standard rules for regular verbs.</p>
